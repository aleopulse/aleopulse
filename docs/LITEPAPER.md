## Privacy-Preserving Polls for the Web3 Era

**Version 1.0 | January 2026**

## The Problem: Anonymity is a Lie

Every day, billions of survey responses are collected worldwide. Organizations promise anonymity, but the reality is different:

- **94%** of consumers say they wouldn't buy from companies that don't protect their data
- **48%** have stopped doing business with companies over privacy concerns
- **26%** of employees fear retaliation from "anonymous" workplace surveys

Traditional survey platforms store IP addresses, digital fingerprints, and metadata that can identify respondents. This isn't anonymity—it's a trust exercise with your data.

**When people don't trust anonymity, they don't give honest answers.**

---

## The Solution: Proven Privacy

LeoPulse is different. Built on Aleo's zero-knowledge proof technology, LeoPulse provides **cryptographically guaranteed privacy**—not just a promise, but mathematical proof.

### How It Works

```
You vote → ZK proof generated → Proof verified on-chain → Vote counted
                ↓
        Your identity stays private
        (even from us)
```

**Zero-knowledge proofs** allow LeoPulse to verify that:
- You're eligible to vote
- Your vote is valid
- You haven't voted before

...without ever knowing WHO you are or WHAT you voted for.
